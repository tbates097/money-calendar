## How It Works

### Transaction Import
- **CSV Upload**: Export bank statements as CSV and upload them
- **Manual Entry**: Add bills and paychecks manually with recurring options
- **Sample Data**: Try the app with sample data instantly
- Automatically categorize transactions as bills or paychecks
- Import selected transactions into your calendar

### Projection Algorithm
1. **Period Calculation**: Divides time into pay periods
2. **Income Tracking**: Sums all paychecks in each period
3. **Bill Management**: Deducts bills from available funds
4. **Carry-Over Logic**: Maintains buffer for future shortages
5. **Safe-to-Save**: Calculates remaining funds after all obligations

### Keyword Matching
The app uses intelligent keyword matching to categorize transactions:

**Bills**: electric, power, energy, utility, water, gas, internet, wifi, phone, mobile, cable, tv, rent, mortgage, insurance, car, auto, loan, credit card, netflix, spotify, amazon prime, gym, membership, subscription, tax, fees, service charge

**Paychecks**: payroll, salary, direct deposit, paycheck, wages, income, deposit, transfer in, credit

## API Routes

The app uses client-side processing for all data import. No server-side API routes are required for the core functionality.

## Data Structure

```typescript
interface Bill {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  recurring: boolean;
  schedule: ScheduleConfig | null;
}

interface Paycheck {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  recurring: boolean;
  schedule: ScheduleConfig | null;
}
```

## Security

- All data is stored locally in your browser
- No sensitive data is sent to external servers
- CSV files are processed locally and not uploaded
- No bank credentials or API keys required for free features
